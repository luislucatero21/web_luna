        <h1>Captain Marvel</h1>
        <p>In response to the popularity of Superman and Batman, Fawcett Comics introduced
            Captain Thunder in the 1939 issue of <a href="#">Flash Comics #1</a>. The issue
            was an ashcan copy, a term for low-print runs whose purpose was not sales
            but to establish a trademark claim for legal purposes. Due to trademark infringements 
            with another established character, Captain Thunder became Captain Marvelous and later
            Captain Marvel. Flash Comics became Whiz Comics (also due to trademark issues.)</p>
        <p>Captain Marvel's alter ego was a 12-year old radio reporter named Billy Batson, a
            copy of Superman's alter ego, reporter Clark Kent, but younger to appeal to adolescent
            readers. Billy Batson's name was partially based on the nickname given to Fawcett Publication's
            founder Wilford Fawcett - "Captain Billy".</p>
